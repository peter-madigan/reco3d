'''
This module contains the base class for Converter-type objects

Converters handle data IO to external services such as file formats, guis, etc, and are
instantiated by Resources.

Each Converter class has the following methods and attributes:
 - a `req_opts` attribute that is a list of required option keys, if an OptionsTool is passed into
 the Converter without all of the keys listed in `req_opts` a RuntimeError is raised
 - a `default_opts` attribute that is a dict of all options with default values
 - an `open()` method that can be called by the parent Resource during the config stage
 - a `close()` method that can be called by the parent Resource during the cleanup stage
 - a `read(dtype, loc=None)` method to read data from external service*
 - a `write(data, loc=None)` method to write data to the external service*

Inheritance from the basic_converters.Converter class provides:
 - a `logger` object of type `LoggingTool`
 - an `options` object of type `OptionsTool`

*Note: There is no specification for the `loc` of data, however the mapping should be clearly
documented in the implementation and unique for each data object.
