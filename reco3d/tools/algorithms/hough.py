            Define a new line using the "Roberts optimal line
            representation."

            Theta and phi use the usual physics spherical coordinate
            definitions and are in radians. Theta (0 to pi/2) represents
            the angle to the z axis. Phi (-pi to pi) represents the angle
            between the projection on the x-y plane and the x axis, with
            the +y direction at phi = pi/2.

            Theta and phi define the direction of the line, represented
            by the unit vector b. xp and yp define the position of the
            line in the following sense:

            - consider the rotation between the unit vector (0, 0, 1) and
              the direction vector b
            - rotate the xyz coordinate system by the same rotation to
              create the primed coordinate system, so that b is now
              pointing in the z-prime direction.
            - xp and yp are the point of intersection between the line
              and the x-prime / y-prime plane

            Angular ambiguities:
              - Theta is restricted to [0, pi/2]
              - There are additional ambiguities if the line lies exactly
                in the x-y plane but I don't think they are relevant.
